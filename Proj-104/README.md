# Project 104 - Jenkins Pipeline as a Code

## About this project
We are going to be exploring Continuous Integration with Jenkins. We are going to see how we can automatically create Jenkins jobs using a Jenkinsfile that defines several stages in our CI/CD pipeline. So in our project of continuous integration with Jenkins, we have created all the jobs manually one by one, and then finally connected them together.  
In this project, we're going to see a scripted way of creating the entire pipeline.
